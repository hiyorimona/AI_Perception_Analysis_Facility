# Block A - Analytics Translator
A creative project brief is more than just a set of instructions. It's an open invitation to unleash your imaginative prowess and shape a project that captivates us all. Get ready to embark on a thrilling journey where we provide you with a clear direction while leaving room for your personal touch and curiousity.

In the ever-evolving realm of data science, projects often come with abstract requirements, like a puzzle waiting to be solved. Picture this: "Can we revolutionize our business processes through the power of data?" That's the kind of challenge we're talking about. But adverse to those mind-bending puzzles, our creative briefs align with specific learning goals.

Now, here's the twist: we want to fuel your curiosity and ingenuity. While the brief sets out certain requirements, we encourage you to spread your wings and explore different learning materials form your own project approaches. We're excited to see how you tackle this enigmatic quest, handpicking an approach that aligns with your Intended Learning Objectives (ILO's).

Ready to dive in? Take a deep breath, absorb the requirements laid out before you, and prepare to dazzle us with your imaginative problem-solving skills. This is your chance to shine and leave us awe-inspired by your creative genius. So, go aheadâ€”unleash your creativity and let the magic unfold (ChatGPT, Rewrite to engage and cringe, 12-07-2023)!

## What you will be doing
In the current block, the creative brief will span the whole block (**8 weeks**) and will focus
on key compentencies of a role unique to the data science and AI industry- **the analytics translator**. Another role you will embody is that of a data scientist doing traditional research and statistical data analyis where we specifically focus on proving causal relationships.

The analytics translator role encompasses several skills such as communication, research, data analysis, and to a large extent, decision making. An analytics translator is a professional who bridges the gap between data analytics and business strategy. They play a critical role in organizations by translating complex data and insights into meaningful, actionable information for decision-makers.

The main responsibilities of an analytics translator include:

- Understanding business goals: Analytics translators work closely with stakeholders and business leaders to understand their objectives, strategies, challenges and needs. They ensure that analytics efforts are aligned with business goals.

- Data analysis and interpretation: Analytics translators possess strong analytical skills and can work with various data sources. They extract, clean, and analyze data to identify trends, patterns, and insights relevant to the business.

- Communication and storytelling: One of the key roles of an analytics translator is to effectively communicate complex analytics concepts to non-technical stakeholders. They use data visualization and storytelling techniques to present insights in a compelling and understandable manner.

- Business strategy alignment: Analytics translators bridge the gap between technical teams and business units. They translate technical findings into actionable recommendations that can drive strategic decision-making.

- Collaboration and teamwork: Analytics translators often work in cross-functional teams, collaborating with data scientists, business analysts, and other stakeholders. They facilitate communication, understanding, and cooperation between these teams to ensure the successful implementation of analytics projects.

- Continuous learning and innovation: Analytics translators stay updated on the latest trends and technologies in analytics. They continuously learn new methodologies and tools to enhance their skills and drive innovation in data-driven decision-making processes.

This list is by no means extensive and is subjected to change, after all; our field is still growing up. Nevertheless, analytics translators and their name sakes play a vital role (as consultants/ business analysts of sorts) in helping organizations leverage data analytics to make informed decisions, improve performance, and gain a competitive edge in the market (ChatGPT, Read and Describe, 12-07-2023).

## Creative Brief: AI at BUAS

The Breda University of Applied Sciences (Buas) recognizes the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on virtually every aspect of our institution. In fact, Buas has made it a strategic priority to become a data-driven organization, where proficiency in working with data and AI is considered a vital competency for [the Buas+ strategy](https://www.buas.nl/sites/default/files/2022-02/BUas%20Strategy%202022-2025.pdf). We believe that all students should possess a fundamental understanding of data and AI to thrive in the evolving landscape.

While the potential benefits of AI are undeniable, we must also acknowledge the risks and disruptions that come along with this groundbreaking technology. At Buas, the upper management has initiated discussions on AI and its applications, but it's crucial to gauge the psychometics (e.g.attitudes, perception, acceptance), knowledge (e.g. what do they know?) and behaviour (e.g. how do they use it?) of different domains within the university towards AI & Data. 

Gaining insight into these different factors can help develop informed policies and seize opportunities to incorporate AI into the curriculum of various domains. This will ensure that our students are well-prepared to navigate the rise of AI in their respective fields. We strive to equip them with the knowledge and skills needed to harness the potential of AI while addressing the challenges it presents; i.e. make BUas and it's students ready for the future.

The future is knocking at our door, and Buas is ready to answer the call. Let's join forces in embracing AI and empowering our students to become the trailblazers who shape the AI-driven world of tomorrow (ChatGPT, 3. Rewrite to engage, 12-07-2023)!


## Goal
**Your goal for this block is to use quantitative and qualitative methods to explore and understand the impact, possibilities and risks for student, staff and the organization as a whole. This will entale, at the minimum, researching the attitudes, knowledge, acceptance, and perceived impact of AI across Buas domains and guiding stakeholders towards the best course of action regarding AI at Buas. Effectively, you'll design and run a mixed-method study; meaning you'll conduct a survey and do interviews, which you'll then analyse using appropriate quantitative and qualitative methods. You'll present your results by a research paper, the results of which should be comprised in a policy paper which in turn should be compressed into a conference poster presentation!**
